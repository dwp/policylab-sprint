        <p>Yasmin is currently experiencing problems with her health due to tummy problems. She also has mental health issues that she is looking to address. She is finding it difficult to get access to the services she needs to get well again. This is affecting her at work and she is feeling stressed.</p>
        <p>The Well in Work service aims to help both employers and employers to have more open conversations and improve well being at work. You contact Yasminâ€™s adviser Alan and find our more about the service at www.wellinwork.gov.uk.</p>
